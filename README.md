# STUDENT-DATA-MGMT-PROJECT
This project is based on the Class 12th CBSE NCERT curriculum and focuses on managing student records efficiently using programming and database concepts.  The system is designed to store, retrieve, update, and manage student information in a structured manner using MySQL database, instead of manual record keeping.
